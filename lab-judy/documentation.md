This project is a very basic chatroom that can be hosted on your terminal. A user can create a username and type a message to the entire chatroom using a number "wack" commands (commands thare prepended with a backslash "\").

In your root server, type in the command "node server.js" in your terminal. Your server will then run on Port 3000.

Preferably in a separate terminal tab, run the command "telnet localhost 3000" to start your chatroom.

As an example, to create a new username of Judy, type in "\user Judy."

In order to display a message to the entire chatroom, type "\all" followed by a space and your message.

A command to directly message another user is currently in progress.
